I do not generally clean or launder and leave this up to the new owner to clean or freshen as needed.  If you desire to clean your items upon receipt, please use care and research proper cleaning methods to preserve condition and avoid damage.\r\n\r\nVery minor &quot;flaws&quot; including as-manufactured flaws are to be expected in quality vintage items and may not be described in the listing; however, if I notice something unusual on inspection I will do my best to describe it accurately.  Where applicable, elastics are gently hand-stretched by me to make sure they have not lost their snap -- badly &quot;ruffled&quot; and dead elastics are not offered for sale.  Items with chips, stains, tears, missing or damaged pieces or other major flaws that interfere with the function or appeal of the piece are not offered for sale.  If you are unhappy with any clothing item or shoes for any reason, including an actual or perceived flaw, please feel free to return it in accordance with my returns policy.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: I measure in inches from seam to seam, laid flat, unstretched, on the outside of the garment.

After 7 days the item will be relisted and you will lose your deposit.  PayPal is the only method of payment available for reserved orders.  This policy is necessary and not negotiable.\r\n\r\nA note on vintage lingerie.  It is not recommended that these items be dry-cleaned or washed in Woolite.  Liquid Ivory dish soap is a gentle alternative and is made to not strip moisture from your hands; it seems not to strip or dry-out your quality vintage lingerie either, leaving it supple and velvety instead.  You will love it!\r\n\r\nA note on vintage jewelry.  Vintage rhinestones including foil backed rhinestones are very delicate and must be cleaned with extreme care, preferably a dry method so as to not damage the foil backings.  In general, metal jewelry as well as glassware and various household items are best cleaned with distilled water and a bit of white vinegar on a soft brush or cloth and then gently patted dry.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer and legal statement: all items are offered  for sale in their found, secondhand condition and no warranties exist, express or implied, including warranty of merchantability and warranty for a particular purpose.

"announcement": "Dear chocolate lover,\r\n\r\nWelcome to my Etsy store where you will find truly unique handmade gourmet chocolate gifts and confections that will delight your senses!\r\n\r\nMy name is Frederic Loraschi and I am a master chocolatier located in Harrisburg Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nI am constantly challenging conventions and questioning what we do every day so that our chocolates and confections are simply an exquisite culinary experience.  I had the chance to learn my craft alongside very passionate chefs around the world. After many years in the field, my need to challenge conventions and constantly question what I do lead me to create Frederic Loraschi Chocolate.\r\n\r\nI enjoy arriving in my shop early in the morning to the fragrance of warm melted chocolate, discovering rare and precious single origin chocolates that are delicate, harmonious and more intense and therefore more alive!\r\n\r\nI love the perfume of caramelized hazelnuts, almonds and peanuts that meticulously processed in our workshop will become our signature pralines.\r\n\r\nSourcing only the finest ingredients leads to the creation of our chocolate collections that will arouse your senses with more flavors and more finesse!\r\n\r\nOur commitment to excellence had Frederic Loraschi Chocolate win the “Best Tasting” award at the U.S. Selection for the World Chocolate Masters in 2010 and “Top 10 Best Chocolatiers” in North America by Dessert Professional magazine in 2011.\r\n\r\nAs an artisan, I am profoundly lucky to be able to share my passion for chocolate with you, my customers.\r\n\r\nAffectionately,\r\nFrederic Loraschi\r\n",

"policy_shipping": "Standard orders in the US ship in 3 business days and are typically 3-5 business days once shipped (or 6-8 business days to your door from the time of placing your order.) \r\n\r\nI also offer 3 expedited services you can choose at check out. \r\n\r\n1)  PRIORITY SHIPPING $4.50 upgrade-  Typically 5-6 business days to your door.\r\n2)  RUSH $12.00 upgrade - Ships next business day PRIORITY  Typically 3-4 business days to your door from placing order.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (6-8 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)\r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!",

"policy_additional": "It is important to include all requested info needed to complete your order.  Missing information will likely delay your order shipment.  Design changes or capitalization requests must be stated separately at check out.  Abbreviations are made where necessary. \r\n\r\nProofs are available at no charge based on request!  Please note a &quot;PROOF REQUEST&quot; on your order at check out if interested!  Proofs must be approved within 14 days or will be shipped as-is.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that some designs have all lowercase font (disregarding proper noun capitalization) per their design -- although this is intended and recommended it can be changed if stated in a separate sentence as a &quot;request for proper noun capitalization&quot;",

There are no chips or cracks (although there are 2 lines in the glass from when it was manufactured that could appear at first glance as a crack).

Just download the file, click the text boxes, and type the names of the food items you&#39;ll be serving! These tents measure 3.5 x 2.5 inches and print four per 8.5 x 11 sheet.\r\n\r\n▧ Please message me if you need a custom age! ▧\r\n\r\nLooking for food tents for a 30th birthday?

You will receive a high quality, 300dpi PDF file customized with your event details. You can then print the file as many times and in whichever way you choose! Please note that you will NOT receive a paper product (unfortunately, I don’t offer printing at this time).*\r\n\r\nQuestions about digital purchases? See this link!:\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/ca/help/article/3949\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\r\n▧ HOW DOES IT WORK? ▧\r\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\r\n\r\n1. Add this item to your Etsy shopping cart.\r\n\r\n2. After purchasing the digital file, you’ll see a link to the Downloads page. Here, you can download all the files associated with your order.\r\n\r\n3. Open the file, click on the text boxes, and type in your information!\r\n\r\n4. Print your food tents! You can use the file to create as many food tents as you need!\r\n\r\n\r\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\r\n▧ HOW DO I PRINT MY FILE? ▧\r\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\r\n\r\nYou have a few printing options. The great thing about DIY printables is that you can print as many as you want, however you want!\r\n\r\nPrint from Home - Print onto white cardstock (at least 110lbs recommended). Remember if you print on cardstock other than white, the colours of the design may vary. Your PDF will include cut marks to follow when cutting them out.\r\n\r\nCommercial Printer – You can print the file using places like Staples, Walmart, etc. Save your PDF to your computer and either order prints on their website or bring the file into your local copy shop on a USB flash drive. Again, cut marks are included as required by these commercial printers.\r\n\r\nOnline Options – Sites like Vistaprint.com offer printing BUT they do not allow standard sizes like 5x7 or 4x6. Please let me know if you are using Vistaprint ASAP so I can change the sizing of your file.\r\n\r\n\r\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\r\n▧ PLEASE NOTE ▧\r\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\r\n\r\nPlease note the colour that you see on your monitor may not be the exact same as your printed product. All monitors are different and display colours different. I recommend printing your proof on your home printer first to make sure you are satisfied with the colours.\r\n\r\nItems are strictly for personal (non-commercial) use only. This material cannot be reproduced, forwarded, shared, or otherwise distributed.\r\n\r\nStripes & Chevron wants to ensure that you are 100% satisfied with your purchase and we will do our best to correct any issues.

Great service and quality from the Madame, as ever!&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;The sample of the Kentucky Bourbon was absolutely perfect. Being a Kentucky fella I can definitely approve, the scent&#39;s layers are as fine as any bourbon here.&quot;",

"policy_welcome": "Welcome to the Madame&#39;s caravan!",
"policy_payment": "All sales from this shop are done through PayPal or credit card. Your order will not ship until after payment is processed.",
"policy_shipping": "Orders will ship within 2-4 business days of purchase. The Madame ships everything via the US Postal Service. They know her, they love her. They snicker at her beard.\r\n\r\nShipping Overage Refunds for Domestic and International Orders:\r\nIf your shipping price seems way too high, don&#39;t be alarmed. Madame will refund you for any significant overages.",
"policy_refunds": "Generally, all sales are final. There are no refunds or exchanges. If you attempt to return an item that has been used (even slightly), you will not receive a refund.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you are truly disappointed in your order, don&#39;t hesitate to contact the Madame to discuss your options, and please do so before leaving feedback.\r\n\r\nMadame does not refund shipping fees.",
"policy_additional": "A Note About Solid Perfumes:\r\nThe Madame&#39;s solids will last you a long time. Store at room temperature and remember that the main ingredient is WAX: if left in your car on a hot summer day, be aware that it will melt, so please use caution when opening the tin. (Fragrance will return to it&#39;s solid state once cooled.)\r\n\r\nHow To Use Solid Perfumes:\r\nSimply rub your finger over the surface of the perfume, and then apply to any area of the body, preferably pulse points (your body heat will strengthen the scent). Solid perfumes are for external use only. DO NOT use as lip balm, or on sensitive areas.\r\n\r\nAllergies:\r\nRead all ingredients carefully before ordering, please - especially if you have known allergies to certain fragrances. Please contact the Madame if you have any questions or concerns. She is generally very quick at replying.\r\n\r\nWholesale:\r\nMost items are available for wholesale, and custom orders are welcome. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask! However, we will not do consignment and we will not ship our products to you without labels. It&#39;s the beard or nothing, baby.\r\nIf you are inquiring about a wholesale order, please provide the following info:\r\n– Your shop name and physical location.\r\n– Website if possible, or any social media links to your business.\r\n– Images of your shop (this is very important, as we want to ensure that we will be a good fit in your space).\r\n– A list of the products you are interested in carrying.\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nPlease note that packages can be delayed in customs for a number of reasons, and on rare occasion you may have to pay an additional fee to claim your package. We apologize that we have no control over this situation. Also please know your country&#39;s guidelines and restrictions for international packages. The most typical reason for packages held in customs is that an item contained within is prohibited by that country.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\nWe are perfectionists and we are pleasers. We receive very little negative feedback, and of course we&#39;d like to keep it that way! We understand that you may not like the scent you ordered – everyone&#39;s nose experiences scents differently. Before leaving any harsh feedback, please do consider other aspects of your experience here. We are quite proud of our customer service and speedy shipping. We work hard to deliver a positive experience with every order. xo",
